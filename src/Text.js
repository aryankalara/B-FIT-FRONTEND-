“Studies show people who keep a food diary are more likely to hit their goals. MyFitnessPal simplifies nutrition and calorie tracking, provides the data you want, and helps you make sense of it all.

Healthy eating is a continuous journey of self-discovery. And the more you track, the more empowered you’ll become to make healthy choices that support your goals.”
